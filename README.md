# ICLR-Data-Visulisation-Analysis
1. Background 
ICLR, the full name is "International Conference on Learning Representations". Founded in 2013 by Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, two of the top three deep learning giants. As we all know, Yoshua Bengio heads the Université de Montréal Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, or MILA, one of the largest artificial intelligence research centers in the world. Yann LeCun is the dean of Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research Institute and is known as the father of convolutional neural networks. This year is the 12th conference. Although it has been held for a short period of time, it has been widely recognized by academic researchers and is the top conference for deep learning. The affiliation participated in 2017 was 362, and its increased to 1378 in 2021.
As for the reason for founding ICLR, we can speculate from the open letter published by Bengio and LeCun on ICLR's official website. It is well known that the application representation of data has a significant impact on the performance of machine learning. The rapid development of representation learning is also accompanied by many problems, such as how can we better learn more meaningful and effective representations from data. We have explored this area, including deep learning, representation learning, metric learning, kernel learning, combinatorial models, very linear structure prediction, and non-convex optimization problems. Although representation learning plays a vital role in machine learning and fields including vision, speech, audio, and NLP, there is currently a lack of a place where scholars can communicate and share topics of interest in the field. The purpose of ICLR is to fill this gap (ICLR是个什么样的会议? - 知乎, 2022).

2. Business Question and Question Justification 
This report committed to explore potential factors that impact paper’s decision to better help authors/affiliations ‘papers improving rating and getting accepted. At first, Google Scholar has updated the ranking of TOP journals and conferences in 2021, and the influence of major international conferences in the field of artificial intelligence has been significantly improved. ICLR's performance was significant ranking tenth, becoming the second AI top meeting in the TOP 10. Secondly, as the place for communication, the more paper being accepted, the more collision of thought will reach an unheard-of depth and width mental. As the result, driving whole industry develop rapidly, more papers will be submitted, and a virtuous circle will be formed. Thirdly, from the authors or affiliation point of view, whether the paper is accepted by oral, poster, etc., the affiliation’s visibility, influence, and voice will be further enhanced. 
Indeed, from 2017 to 2021, the author’s count from the top Ten contributed affiliation is continually increased (figure 2.1).  
 
Those leading companies and universities committed a lot of money and personnel into the ICLR year by year and dedicated research new topics representing the author or affiliation yearned for recognition.
